# --- Bash command splitter ----------------------------------------------------
#
# A small, dependency-free splitter that walks a bash command string and
# returns the individual commands within it. We need just enough of bash's
# syntax to find command boundaries — we do NOT execute, expand, or even
# fully parse arbitrary bash. The grammar we recognise is:
#
#   * Operators that separate commands at the current scope:
#       && || ; | & newline
#     (single & is backgrounding, also a separator)
#   * Quoting: '...' (literal), "..." (with $() and `` live), \X (escape)
#   * Substitutions whose contents are themselves commands:
#       $(...)   command substitution
#       `...`    command substitution (backtick form)
#       <(...)   process substitution (read)
#       >(...)   process substitution (write)
#       (...)    subshell
#   * Parameter expansion ${...} (contents are NOT commands, but may
#     contain $(...) which IS a command)
#   * Redirections that include & as a fd reference: >&N, <&N, &>, &>>
#
# Anything we don't recognise (heredocs, ANSI-C $'...' quoting, control
# constructs like `case`, etc.) raises _ParseError, which the caller turns
# into a safe "ask" fallback. Missing-but-safe is the design: a parser bug
# can never silently ALLOW a dangerous command — at worst it forces an
# extra confirmation prompt.
